project 2 homework file for coding bootcamp

userStory1 - As a person in a relationship, I find it usefull to send images that convey how I feel to my partner.

userStory2 - As a person that already uses giphy to send chats I would find it really usefull to be able to find new/fresh images w/o having to scroll through pages of content that I've used or already seen before.
